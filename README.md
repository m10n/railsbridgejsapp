# railsbridgejsapp

This is a basic Javascript to-do list app completed during Railsbridge's San Francisco Javascript event. This version includes a 'delete item' feature as well as 'mark as complete.'

Railsbridge is a free, fun weekend coding workshop for women and their guests. If you're interested in making an app of your own, you can [complete the tutorial online](http://docs.railsbridge.org/javascript-to-do-list/) or attend an [upcoming Railsbridge workshop](http://www.railsbridge.org/learn/events) in your city.
